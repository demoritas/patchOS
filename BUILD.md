## Building patchOS

### 1. Install Vagrant

Head to [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and download Vagrant.

### 2. Set up the patchOS build environment

In your `patchOS` source directory:
```sh
$ vagrant up && vagrant halt && vagrant up
```

First time setup will take about 1 hour on a half decent laptop.  
The reason for halting and upping is to load any new kernel updates that was installed when upgrading Arch Linux.

### 3. Build patchOS

```sh
$ vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/vagrant-build"
```

This will take about 40 minutes on a half decent laptop.

The final `patchOS` image will be in the `release` directory if everything went smoothly.

### Compress image before creating a release

```sh
$ tar cf - patchOS-rpi4.img | pigz > patchOS-rpi.img.tar.gz
```

### Default users in patchOS

The default user is `patch` with password `patch`.  
The `root` user has password `root`. Safety third ;-)  
There is minimal safety implemented â€“ root cannot login via SSH.
